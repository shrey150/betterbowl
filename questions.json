One type of this technique exploits capillary action on an activated glass plate, while in another type of this process, pressurized gas forces the elutant through small grains of silica to increase the flow rate. That \"flash\" type of this method is an example of the \"column\" type, which uses a solid stationary phase and a solvent as the mobile phase.

          "Samples are converted into gas phase ions that are then sorted by their m/z (\"m to z\") ratios in this analytical technique. The ionization of the sample is done by a laser in the MALDI form of this technique."
